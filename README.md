# PTT - Pentest Tools
Disclaimer: **I did NOT create or develop any of these tools**

This is still a work in a progress as I am adding additional tools and updating the script as I got. Any constructive criticism welcome or any other tool suggestions are welcome as well.

This is just a simple bash script to install and get some tools I like to use when doing CTFs, testing against my own virtual environemnts, TryHackMe, HackTheBox, etc. It installs the tools to the /opt/ directory(except bettercap is under ~/.go/). As I use ZSH it adds alias to my .zsh file for some of these as well.

This list includes tools such as:
[Nmap](https://nmap.org/), [Sqlmap](https://sqlmap.org/), [Tshark](https://tshark.dev/), [TCPDump](https://www.tcpdump.org/), [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/), [GoBuster](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster), [dirb](https://salsa.debian.org/pkg-security-team/dirb), [Bettercap](https://www.bettercap.org/), [Kismet](https://www.kismetwireless.net/), [Aircrack](https://github.com/aircrack-ng/aircrack-ng), [Hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/)(and its tools), [Unicorn](https://github.com/trustedsec/unicorn), [SEToolkit](https://github.com/trustedsec/social-engineer-toolkit), [BeEF](https://github.com/beefproject/beef), [Metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/), [Nessus](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus), [Burpsuite](https://portswigger.net/burp), [Pixiewps](https://github.com/wiire-a/pixiewps), [Reaver](https://github.com/t6x/reaver-wps-fork-t6x), [Bully](https://github.com/kimocoder/bully), [Cowpatty](https://salsa.debian.org/pkg-security-team/cowpatty), [DirBuster](https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/dirbuster), [John The Ripper](https://www.openwall.com/john/), [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists), [THC-Hydra](https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra), [TheHarvester](https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester), [Impacket](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket), and [PEASS](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng). This will also ask if you want to install [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) if you want to use cuda for hashcat as well as [RTL8812AU](https://github.com/aircrack-ng/rtl8812au) drivers if you have that WiFi chipset.

** Will Be adding in OpenVAS Soon **
