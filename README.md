# PTT - Pentest Tools
Disclaimer: **I did NOT create or develop any of these tools**

This is still a work in a progress as I am adding additional tools and updating the script as I got. Any constructive criticism welcome or any other tool suggestions are welcome as well.

This is just a simple bash script to install and get some tools I like to use when doing CTFs, testing against my own virtual environemnts, TryHackMe, HackTheBox, etc. It installs the tools to the /opt/pentest directory(except bettercap is under ~/.go/). As I use ZSH it adds alias to my .zsh file for some of these as well.
